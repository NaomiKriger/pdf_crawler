# Welcome to pdf_crawler!
This is a RESTful API project, which enables you the followings:
* updload a PDF file, which should contain list of phones, using a POST request
* get all PDF files, and the phone numbers that each PDF contains
* get all phone numbers, and the list of PDFs in which these phone numbers appeared

The app was developed in Python, using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
I hope you will find it useful.

Thanks,
Naomi
